SMARTQUARIUM is an application for water monitoring especially aquarium for aquascape and fish monitored. 
Using DS18B20 sensor, gravity: TDS sensor, and gravity: Turbidity sensor. 

There are several parameter : TDS, Temp, Time, pH, and turbidity
But in our cases, pH still failed to be added because of in need for dc-dc isolator and can't be on the same board with TDS meter. 

So in these cases, we checked pH from pH indicator, and we monitored the TDS. 

This application is based on ANTARES website application. There are nodejs file, android MIT APP Inventor aia file, and arduino file.
