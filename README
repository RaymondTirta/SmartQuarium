SMARTQUARIUM is an application for water monitoring especially aquarium for aquascape and fish monitored. 
Using DS18B20 sensor, gravity: TDS sensor, and gravity: Turbidity sensor. 

There are several parameter : TDS, Temp, Time, pH, and turbidity
But in our cases, pH still failed to be added because of in need for dc-dc isolator and can't be on the same board with TDS meter. 

So in these cases, we checked pH from pH indicator, and we monitored the TDS. 

This application is based on ANTARES website application. There are nodejs file, android MIT APP Inventor aia file, and arduino file.

a little bit notes about the pH meter since DFRobot documentation is in chinese with gibberish english on their web:
# PH Meter
needs to be calibrated at certain value, acidic & basic buffer.
voltage output (supposedly) 0-4 V ~ 0-14 PH
store the probe on 3 M KCl 
clean before and after usage
you could infact stir the solution using the pH meter, confused ? ask DFRobot. it's their word. No, i mean serously. i don't think any sane chemist would do that but idk since i'm not chemist. i mean...
If the reading is inaccurate you could try to soak the probe on 9 ml 0,1 M HCl + 1 L H2O for 24 hours and then soak it inside 3 M KCl for a couple of hours.
also, incase if the probe broke you could change it with another of the same type. Ag-AgCl pH probe
